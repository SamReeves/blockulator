The dominant EVM math libraries hold a value to about 18 decimal places and are fine for one multiplication. A lending protocol does not do one multiplication. It accrues every block, and after N accruals the rounding has been applied N times. The [ladder](/demo/) runs that loop through ABDKMath64x64, Solady, PRBMath and FP127 against exact arithmetic and counts the digits that survive. FP127 keeps about twenty more at every N.
